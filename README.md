To What Extent Does Income Affect Voting Behavior When Accounting For Race?

In heavily Hispanic Californian neighborhoods, wealth had no relationship with voting patterns in the 2008 United States presidential election and the 2010 California gubernatorial election. An area’s voting patterns are often considered to be linked with its wealth. Analysis of this relationship, however, is confounded by the fact that the affluence of an area is also linked with its racial composition (and ethnicity in itself is a very important predictor of voting patterns). This study broke the endogeneity problem by looking at Californian Census Block Groups in which Hispanics compose more than 95% of the overall population. Using 2007-2011 American Community Survey data, the study regressed the Democratic share of the vote won in a Census Block Group during the 2008 United States presidential election and the 2010 California gubernatorial election to the Census Block Group’s median household income. Median household income was not found to be statistically significant. Further regressions using poverty rates, quadratic regressions, dummy variables, controls for country of origin, and heavily white neighborhoods did not find a consistently significant relationship between wealth and voting patterns.
